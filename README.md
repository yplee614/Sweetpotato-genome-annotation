Re-annotation of taizhong 6 genome

Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) is a globally cultivated root crop of paramount significance. The hexaploid genome, known as ‘Taizhong 6’, has been sequenced and serves as a crucial reference genome for sweetpotato and related species within the Convolvulaceae family. However, the current annotation of the sweetpotato genome relies primarily on ab initio predictions and, to a lesser extent, transcriptome datasets, which only predict coding sequences. Therefore, an improved annotation is highly desirable. Here, we present a comprehensive reannotation of the sweetpotato genome, leveraging twelve Nanopore full-length RNA libraries and 190 Illumina RNA-seq libraries. The improved annotation, named v1.0.a2, includes 42,751 gene models, with 97.4% complete BUSCOs. Within this comprehensive set of gene models, we have modified or added 31,771 gene models and identified 8,736 genes with alternatively spliced isoforms. Moreover, we have introduced a new gene ID nomenclature (IbXXGXXXXX) as an improvement over the previous nomenclature (gene.gXXXXX). Additionally, we have annotated and provided expression levels of miRNAs and their targets at different storage roots stages.
